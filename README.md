# Immersive-VR-Space-Field-Trip
Immersive VR Space Field Trip is my Final Year Project for Brunel University

This is a VR education application that aims to teach students about astronomy where the players can "Learn & Explore" and participate in the "Solar System Mini Game". 

## Learn & Explore
Students are able to chose from two planets to visit "Mars" and the "Moon". Students are able to explore the environment, while information points are scattered around the environment explaining facts about the planet that they are on with the use of videos and text. 


## Solar System Mini Game
Students are able to learn about our solar system through the "Solar System Mini Game" where the student aims to place a podium of planets onto a Solar System model, if they get the right submission, they win the mini game.
